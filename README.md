# Learning TypeScript

Welcome to the journey of learning TypeScript through Test-Driven Development (TDD). This repository is
designed for self-paced exploration, allowing me to deepen my understanding of TypeScript concepts through hands-on
coding and testing.

## Introduction

This repository is organized into a series of topics, each of which is contained in its own directory. Each directory is
consisted of files.

* `topic.ts` - The code file for the topic.
* `topic.test.ts` - The unit test file for the topic.
* `README.md` - The lesson description.

Lets' explore the topics in [here](./src).
